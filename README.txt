  I used ankh2054's linux-pentest repo to enumerate
a system that I was attacking during a VulnHub challenge.
I really enjoyed the idea of following alongside his
machine enumerator to get a better idea of how to
enumerate a machine myself.  This led to me re-writing
a machine enumerator closely following ankh2054.

Details:

  This is used to enumerate machine details and is ever
expanding to include more and more as I get more time to
work on this.

  ! This is a WIP !
